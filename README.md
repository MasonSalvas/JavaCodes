# JavaCodes
This was a few Java codes that I was given to try out for an interview a while back and figured I would post them here if anyone wanted help or maybe see what some companies ask.

# Please Note
Java is not my strongest language (as of this date (Oct/2016)) but I am looking to be doing more with Java.
